                <p>Hello! I am a Senior Computer Science student here at the University of Maryland, College Park.
                    I currently work for a company named Interclypse, located in Annapolis Junction, MD as a
                    Full Stack Software Engineer. I enjoy watching sports, eating chipotle, and hanging out with my friends.

                    <h2>Sofiac Travel Industry Framework</h2>
                    <p>My current role is working with Sofiac's Travel Platform, a comprehensive solution designed to simplify
                         the intricate tasks associated with managing a car rental business. It is a user-friendly car rental
                         software is a one-stop-shop, enabling you to effortlessly oversee an entire fleet, reservations,
                         and contracts through a web-based platform. On a day-to-day basis I use ReactJS, Java, and MongoDB.

                    <h2>Analysis of Movie Spending</h2>
                    <p>I conducted a comprehensive data analysis by harnessing the power of data manipulation
                         libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and the versatile Jupyter environment. 
                         The primary objective of this analytical endeavor was to meticulously scrutinize and 
                         assess the efficiency with which movie studios allocate their financial resources. 
                         Through a systematic exploration of the dataset, I delved into the intricate dynamics of 
                         budget allocation in the world of cinema, shedding light on critical insights that underpin 
                         the decision-making processes of these influential entities. This data-driven investigation stands 
                         as a testament to the profound impact that modern technology and analytics have on our ability 
                         to unravel and understand complex industry practices.

                    <h2>Poker Simulator in Java</h2>
                    <p>I created a Java program that mimics the dynamics of a poker game, complete with an engaging and
                         interactive user interface. This project was particularly enjoyable for me because I have a
                         genuine passion for playing poker.
